## Project Guide

Welcome to my Github page. This is a brief summary of the projects that I have completed for General Assembly's Data Science Immersive:

#### Capstone Project
Online content is rife with clickbait articles. I predicted whether an article was clickbait or not using natural language processing (NLP), incorporating simple classifiers as well as neural network models. 

#### Project 1
Using the Pokemon dataset, containing a list of all first generation Pokemon, I created a "Pokedex" that allows for the addition of new players into a dictionary. Basic descriptive statistics with functions to enable in-game mechanics like calculating the probability of encountering a Pokemon.

#### Project 2
I examined the SAT scores across different states in the US and performed EDA on the dataset.

#### Project 3
With the Ames housing dataset, I developed an algorithm to estimate the value of residential houses based on fixed and renovatable characteristics.

#### Project 4
Scraping Indeed.com's websites across six countries, I explored the salaries of data scientists and used job descriptions to predict whether the listing was for a bona fide data scientist job.

#### Project 5
Proper customer segmentation is key to increasing revenue. I used client information from a bank to predict whether a person was likely to take up a term deposit.
